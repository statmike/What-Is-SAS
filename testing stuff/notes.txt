viya/cas product - make sure cas is removed from compared products
viya/not cas product -


action sets by products https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&cdcVersion=9.4_3.5&docsetId=allprodsactions&docsetTarget=actionSetsByProduct.htm&locale=en


IDEA:
  Product chart without Procedures
  Add Procedures
  Add ActionSets
  Add Actions
  Add edges between procedures
  Make drillable: Overview > Product > Procedures or ActionSet





- [X] replace & with &amp; for xml in SVG
- [X] Add strict
- [X] Direction LR
- [X] Shade cluster
- [ ] Manual Prune Edges?????
    - [ ] remove links to PRINT (maybe others in future)
    - [ ] CAS
- [ ] CLEANUP
  - [X] remove links to self: DBF
  - [X] why is there a link to PDS ... (Not under a product/cluster...)
  - [X] why is MCMC under Econometrics
  - [X] why is MODEL not under a Product (SAS/ETS)
  - [X] optmodel should be under sas/econometrics and SAS/OR
  - [6] for procs with same PROC_SHORT (link within cluster)
    - [ ] Subcluster
- [ ] How to determine if CAS enabled???
- [X] Add hover text on nodes/urls
- [ ] More Scraping
  - [ ] Get text for hovering on URL: Products, PROCS, Edges
  - [ ] Create list of Viya Procs from other page
    - [ ] Create flags: Viya, 9.4, Both
  - [ ] Save links to Product List of procs
- [ ] Alpha order of nodes needs fixing
- [ ] Graph Sequenced and drillable - see notes (paper)




MANUALLIST =['SAS Econometrics','SAS Optimization','SAS Visual Statistics','SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning','SAS Visual Forecasting','SAS Visual Text Analytics']
for products
    if not in vdriver then "SAS 9.4"
    elif in MANUALLIST then "Viya / CAS engine"
    else 'can add to Viya'
note: SAS Econometrics comes with SAS/ETS, SAS Optimization comes with SAS/OR, SAS Visual Statistics comes with SAS/STAT, SAS Graph,
Note: SAS IML comes with SAS/IML
Note: Visual Analytics is baseline and comes with part of SAS/BASE (some are CAS enabled), SAS CAS
Note: can add SAS/CONNECT, SAS SPDS, SAS QC, - NO CAS for these
Note: prerequisits are VA < VS < VDMML, VA < VTA, VA<VF, VA<SAS Econ, VA<SAS Opt


current list
1 - clean 1_crawler
2 - add action level to 1_crawler
3 - clean 2_process: dataset references and split code
4 - clean 3_graphs overview
4 - clean 3_graphs hairball
